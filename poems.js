        slug: "two-parallel-worlds",
        content: `Living in two parallel worlds, perhaps there was a verse
A verse that only my heart could find, and the one that my mind denied.
Two worlds, two minds, two hearts, and yet, they intertwine.

A city girl blinded by her dreams, rushing through the streets beneath the daylight's beam,
A countryside girl, living a still life, with nothing but the love that abides.
A life full of ambition, or a life full of soul
How can I balance them both?

A girl who desires nothing but independence, to stand on her own,
And a girl who seeks nothing but the warmth of the sun, to forget the world's wrongs.
A girl who craves adventure, who loves the thrill,
While another seeks nothing but stillness in the hills.

Maybe I want more. Maybe I long for something that calms my soul,
A place where both dreams and peace can coexist.
Is it too much to ask for a life that encompasses all of this?
To live freely, yet with depth, to chase ambition while finding tranquility in this ebb

        title: "Is It Wrong or Is It Right?",
        slug: "is-it-wrong-or-is-it-right",
        content: `Looking all around the world  
One might believe we're truly lost,  
In battles that come at a bitter cost.  

Is it wrong? Is it right?  
To strike the dark and praise the light?  
If justice hunts the parasite,  
Then punishment shouldn't it be just, not spite?  

They say war is cursed, they condemn it loud,  
But when pushed, even peace wears a shroud.  
I'm not cheering for the bombs or guns,  
Not for the fallen fathers, daughters, sons.  

I don't stand with the war cries,  
Nor the trauma in children's eyes.  
But I do believe, with all my might,  
The wrong must fall, and the right earn light.  

Let justice roar, not missiles in skies  
Let truth stand tall where the innocent cries.  
I don't want drama. I don't want hate.  
I just want time to rewind the fate.  

I want my heart to rise, not sink,  
No more nights on the fearful brink.  
No more mornings filled with dread,  
Wondering who's alive, who's dead.  

I trust my soldiers, my nation's might,  
Their courage gleams in darkest night.  
But even the brave, in duty grand,  
Can't stop what slips from human hands.  

So I pray, not for vengeance, but for grace,  
To wake each day, and see their face.  
To hold to peace, not in fear, but pride  
With no more blood in morning tide.  

Let the world heal, let the rage cease,  
I ask not for war… I just ask for peace.

        content: `A girl like binary sort  
But one you'll never solve.  
For as you try to fix the code,  
You'll wish you'd never got involved.  

As complex as the depths of DSA,  
My thoughts don't stay just one way.  
Who was I? What was I not?  
Fighting battles with every thought.  

Unique like my name, my stream of mind,  
Not someone you'll ever define.  
You can trace me like a company's tree,  
But wait until you truly see.  
One by one, my steps unfold,  
You like me for a bit, but never the whole.  

Debug won't help, not this time.  
Error logs scream louder than rhyme.  
And still...  
These lungs, they keep me awake  
A heartbeat I can no longer fake.

        content: `The nights were heavy with tears of the past,
Was it the love we shared or the shadow that we cast?
I wasn't all right, and you weren't all wrong,
Perhaps we both fought battles unknown all along.

Our youthful years, laced with sorrow and strain,
Maybe I wasn't enough, or you felt no chain.
You gave her the place where I longed to be
How could you choose her, forgetting me?

I gasped for air beneath heartache's tide,
I forgave you once, then twice but you lied.
Your words and your actions never aligned,
And slowly, love faded from my heart and mind.

What we once were, we can never be,
My heart now carries those scars silently.
Yet somehow, it longs for the you that I knew
A ghost of a love that never stayed true.

Years have passed, and life moves on,
But deep in my chest, the ache lingers on.

        content: `Bottled-up emotions of despair and agony,  
They whisper loud in this quiet cacophony.  
Is it fine for me to stay in this ebony?  
A darkness I wear like it's a part of me.  

Words like resilience and fleeting felicity  
Crack under the weight of my own anxiety.  
Hope slips through fingers too tired to fight,  
Yet I keep walking through the absence of light.  

I don't reach out, I don't complain,  
I carry the silence, I carry the pain.  
Maybe the world won't notice I stayed,  
But I'll bloom in the cracks where I once decayed...

        content: `My mind was in a storm of wrath
For everything he did, everything he brought.
Maybe I was weak,
Maybe I was wrecked,
But didn't I say
Being with me would only bring havoc?

        slug: "unloved",
        content: `Maybe it wasn't me maybe it was the hurt in me.  
Love never came easy, not sure why,  
Was it my childhood or our last goodbye?

Maybe it was my story left half-told,  
Or the way I broke before I got to hold.  
Fear grew loud and took over the good,  
My doubts ruined more than I ever understood.

Every time something came close to that pain,  
I panicked, overthought, started the same game.  
Loving and leaving, leaving and loving was all just the same,  
It made me panic to my stomach, the patterns that repeat.

How should I behave? What shouldn't I repeat?  
Thoughts crept in my mind, and when I had the courage  
To speak my heart they waved their goodbyes.  
People came, they stayed, they saw, they ran.

What should I do? How should I process?  
Was I a maniac, or was I too hard to impress?  
How do I make them see that I was trying my best?  
Maybe love was never meant for this maniac.

        content: `My sanity just got disrupted  
Something inside my heart was irrupted  
Filled with rage and vengeance,  
Mere words played their cruel sentence  

Detesting the company of my peer, but  
sometimes I wish someone was here  
Became a confidant to many,  
yet desolation was my only company  

Pondering over the things I can't get right  
All messed up deep inside  
Maybe this is insane, maybe this is alright  
Deep down, I wish I was doing this life right...

        content: `I'm calling you, but you're not there,
The phone rings empty in the air.
Maybe you're busy, maybe you're gone,
But I still hope you'll call back soon.

The silence echoes in my ear,
A reminder that you're not near.
I miss your voice, I miss your laugh,
I miss the way you made me feel safe.

So I'll keep calling, day and night,
Hoping that you'll pick up the line.
Because in this world of uncertainty,
Your voice is my only certainty.

        title: "Toxic",
        slug: "toxic",
        content: `A word we toss, like stones in streams "You're toxic," we often say and believe 
We label others with sharp disdain,
Blind to the shadows of our own pain.
The first true act of poison's trace
Is calling out another's face. 
Each of us wears a fractured mask,
Hiding hurt behind every task.
It's not always envy, not always pain
Sometimes it's just empathy that we slains. 
And yet, when I asked, "What's their and mine 
They won't even matter in a couple of time
But still, I wish them healing, in infinite ways.
Even if I don't like you, I won't cast blame,
Nor call you "toxic" in a careless name. 
I'd rather pause, try to retain 
Reach for your truth with an open hand.
For toxic, it's not you it's not me it's us i exclaim 
For it lives in all of us i blame
